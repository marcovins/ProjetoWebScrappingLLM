##  Public Cloud Infrastructure. Modern Platform Endorphins. <br><br>The most flexible and powerful compute platform on any public cloud. Fly Machines are hardware-virtualized containers, running on our own hardware, that launch instantly and run exactly as long as you want them to — for a single HTTP request, or for weeks of uptime. <br><br>![](/phx/ui/images/fly-globe-cb332f77ddb429aa3ef4e0a2c6c592ba.png?vsn=d)<br><br>  * ##  Get Right in Your Users’ Faces <br><br>Deploy in 35 regions, from Sydney to São Paulo, for sub-100ms response times and native-app feel no matter where your users are. <br><br>  * ##  Fork Off VMs Like They’re Processes <br><br>Fly Machines start fast enough to handle HTTP requests, run only when you need them, and scale into tens of thousands of instances. <br><br>  * ##  Ship GPU-Boosted Models <br><br>From LLMs to inferencing, hardware acceleration with the same developer experience as a simple CRUD app. <br><br>  * ##  Built for Distributed Systems <br><br>Clustered databases like Cockroach, globally-distributed Postgres, and modern RPC systems like Elixir FLAME, no Terraform required. <br><br><br><br><br>![](/phx/ui/images/cool-bird-d997174954ab5a152ccac3d2dcb19c8d.png?vsn=d)<br><br>##  Support By Developers For Developers <br><br>Paid support packages include a team of actual engineers (not chatbots) who themselves ship code on our platform.

That's Fly Machines—serverless compute is a trade-off you no longer need to make. Graduate to a full-stack cloud to regain control over your stack & hosting bill. <br><br>  * ###  Boots in 250ms or Less <br><br>Functions and apps boot and respond to web requests in 250ms or less with Fly Machines. You decide to keep them running or automatically put them to sleep. <br><br>  * ###  Built for JavaScript Developers <br><br>JavaScript, TypeScript, Bun, Deno—whatever your flavor, Fly Launch automatically detects your runtime and generates a VM with everything you need to run your app. <br><br>  * ###  Real GPUs & CPUs on the Edge <br><br>Run workloads that require GPUs or lots of CPUs, memory, and storage in over 30 regions around the world—all interconnected by a private, encrypted WireGuard network that works out of the box. <br><br><br><br><br>  * [ ](/phoenix/)<br>  * [ ](/sveltekit/)<br>  * [ ](/rails/)<br>  * [ ](/docs/getting-started/dockerfile/)<br>  * [ ](/docs/getting-started/golang/)<br>  * [ ](/docs/rust/)<br>  * [ ](/django/)<br>  * [ ](/laravel/)<br>  * [ ](/nextjs/)<br><br><br><br>![](/phx/ui/images/better-together-bg-630f84dc36727cb3216fe4536c3687db.png?vsn=d)<br><br>##  Developer-Focused Public Cloud <br><br>Help us build the next public cloud.
