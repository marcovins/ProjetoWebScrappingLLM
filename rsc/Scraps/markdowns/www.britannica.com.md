Today marks the 35th anniversary of the debut of The Simpsons. Beginning as a short on the Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons has become a cultural juggernaut, as well as the longest-running sitcom in U.S. television history. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie (as well as dozens of supporting characters) helped jump-start the fledgling Fox network. They’re also the core of a multibillion-dollar merchandise empire.

The Simpsons creator Matt Groening got his start drawing the comic Life in Hell, and his later work included the meme-spawning comedy Futurama.

The Simpsons has rather famously predicted the future on several occasions, anticipating the presidency of Donald Trump, the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, and the recipients of two Nobel Prizes.

With apologies to Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Missouri, Groening has confirmed that the Simpsons’ hometown was inspired by Springfield, Oregon (monorail not included).
