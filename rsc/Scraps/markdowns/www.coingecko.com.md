Welcome to CoinGecko! As crypto traders and investors ourselves, we understand the hassle of browsing multiple websites and exchanges to find reliable information and market data for a coin. That’s why we built CoinGecko – so you can access all crypto information in one place.

Crypto prices and market data have always been at the core of our product – it’s what we do best. We provide unbiased cryptocurrency data for the community, whether to help you make an investment decision or check the value of your crypto assets.

We use an average price as crypto prices vary between markets. Crypto prices on an exchange depend on its market condition, influenced by factors like liquidity, trading pairs, offerings, and economic conditions. As exchanges may sometimes show abnormal prices, the crypto community relies on tools like CoinGecko for more accurate coin prices.

Crypto prices alone don’t mean much, so we’ve included data like market cap and fully diluted value. It’s only when you pair current prices with historical data, statistics, news, and more that you get a full picture of a coin’s performance.

Another popular feature on CoinGecko is our free and powerful crypto charts. What’s neat is you can compare a coin’s performance against Bitcoin and/or Ethereum on a single graph. Our price charts come in both line and candlestick formats, and we also offer market cap charts.

Our prices are calculated using an average price formula based on available trading pairs across multiple exchanges. We also have algorithms to detect and exclude anomalous tickers from our prices. Learn more about our methodology.

You can get real-time coin prices with our cryptocurrency price tracker by clicking on the coins in the table above. Our price trackers are usually sufficient for regular investors. But if you’re an advanced trader looking for more granular price data or a developer building crypto applications showing market data, our API gives you a comprehensive set of crypto data, including live and historical crypto prices, market cap, market volume, and more.

If you’re looking for crypto prices in your local currencies, check out our cryptocurrency pairs:

Crypto market cap is the total value of a cryptocurrency in circulation, calculated by multiplying the total number of coins by the current market price. It’s used to determine the valuation of a cryptocurrency based on the total money invested, not just the price.

Investors use crypto market caps to determine if a coin has more room for growth or is currently overvalued by comparing it to established cryptocurrencies with similar use cases as a benchmark. While market cap is important, it’s only one of many factors to consider when investing in a coin.

Crypto market cap can be divided into three categories:

These categories are often used in investment strategies, and a “good market cap” depends on your risk appetite. If you’re willing to take on higher risks, you can look into small- or mid-cap cryptocurrencies. For risk-averse investors, consider large-cap cryptocurrencies.

Our cryptocurrency list features the top cryptocurrencies today, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and over ten thousand altcoins. What sets our list apart is we aggregate cryptos from various exchanges to give a full picture of the crypto market and not just for coins on a particular exchange.

Our team curates the cryptocurrency list. We vet each coin to reduce the risk of scams and remove inactive coins or dead projects to keep our list relevant to the market. If you can’t find a coin on CoinGecko, try searching on our DEX tracker GeckoTerminal.

We rank cryptocurrencies by market cap. Market cap represents the market share of a coin or token, so the higher the crypto rank, the more dominant it is in the crypto market.

Altcoins are every other cryptocurrency created after Bitcoin, and they can be coins or tokens. Coins are native currencies to the blockchain, while tokens are cryptos built on the blockchain.

There are many types of altcoins. Stablecoins are altcoins whose value is pegged to assets like fiat currencies and commodities. Another example is governance tokens, which let you vote for the Web3 project’s future. You can explore more types of altcoins on our categories pages.

Getting into crypto can be daunting. But our beginner-friendly articles and videos are there to help you take your first steps into the decentralized internet.

As for crypto investors, you can create custom portfolios to track the performance of coins you're interested in. Many of our pro-users use our crypto highlights to discover crypto gems and see what’s popular today.

No matter where you are in your crypto journey, we want to empower you with unbiased fundamental crypto data you need to thrive in this Web3 world. We’re excited to see you around!
